The datasets that can be used for time series forecasting
Power load datasets: To comprehensively evaluate the proposed method under di-verse operational scenarios, a collection of six power load datasets originating from dis-tinct geographical regions and featuring varying sampling periods are collected. The first one comprises electricity consumption data for Ireland spanning from 2020/01/01 to 2020/06/30, recorded at a 30 minutes sampling interval. This dataset captures 8736 sam-ples, which is named AELm30. The second dataset is the electricity consumption from UK over the period 2023/01/01 to 2023/06/30, with a recording time interval of 30 minutes and 8688 samples, named YGm30. The third covers the power load from Brazil throughout the entire year of 2022 (2022/01/01 to 2022/12/31), with a recording time interval of one hour, which recorded 8761 samples and is named as BXh1. The fourth dataset consists of the power load data for Bangladesh during 2020/01/01 to 2020/12/31, sampled at a time in-terval of 1 hour, recorded 8784 samples and named MJLh1. The fifth one captures the electricity consumption  from Morocco during 2020/01/01 to 2020/03/31, with a recording time interval of 10 minutes, which has 12960 samples and named MLGm10. The sixth is the power load from Turkey for the full year of 2019 (2019/01/01 to 2019/12/31), with a re-cording time interval of 1 hour. This dataset captures 8760 samples, which is named TEQh1.
Public datasets: To rigorously assess the generalization capability of the proposed method across diverse domains, an additional set of six public datasets from different re-gions and different fields are collected. The first public dataset is the high effective load of a transformer in a county in China from 2016/10/1 to 2018/5/31, with a recording time in-terval of 1 hour, which has 14592 samples and is named as TFh1. The second one collect-ed at 10 minutes intervals with 52704 data points. This dataset documents ambient tem-perature variations in a certain place in the United States from 2020/1/1 to 2020/12/31, which is named Tempm10. The third is the air quality data measured the PM2.5 particu-late concentration from 2010/1/1 to 2010/12/31 in Beijing, China, with a record time inter-val of 1 hour, which records 8760 samples and is named BJPM2.5h1. The fourth dataset is captured at 10 minutes sampling intervals by a meteorological station, this dataset quan-tifying atmospheric CO2 concentration data from 2024/1/1 to 2024/12/31, with a recording time interval of 10 minutes and sample number of 52704, named CO2m10. The fifth one covering the opening stock data of the New York Stock Exchange from 1970/1/2 to 2017/11/10, with no fixed recording time interval. It has 12074 samples and is named Stocks. The sixth dataset is the electrocardiograph data, the sampling frequency is 100Hz(0.01-second resolution) and with entries totaling 17935, which is named as ECG.
